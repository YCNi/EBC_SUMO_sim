## Introduction
This repository contains the SUMO simulation package of the E-Bike CIty project using the city center of Zurich as the case study network. In the four scenarios available (morning/evening, fixed-time/actuated signal control), 75% of the trips are shifted from cars to bicycles. Python codes which can produce average OD travel times and network fundamental diagrams are also provided.

## Instructions
